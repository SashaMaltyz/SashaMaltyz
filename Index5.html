  <p1>Fhotos in websites are very important. And they are similiar important: backgrounds or normal images: they are same. So, let's try to add photo in your website. First let's try to write code in html:<ul>
  <li> Img src="url of your picture" </li>
    <p3>Then, if you want, you can change size of image with commands</p3>
    <li> width: 0px</li>
    <li>height: 0px</li>
    </ul>
    <p2> Then, let's write css code. Like with text, there's a lot of commands to decorate or change your image. Let's look at them:
      <ol><li> width: 0px</li>
      <li> height: 0px</li></ol>
      Then, ypur images are ready! Thanks for watching!
